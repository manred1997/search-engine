# Mistyped errors and misspelled errors

Spelling errors are divided into 2 categories:

 - `Mistyped (Typographic)` errors are errors related to typing. (called `Conventional`)
 - Compared to `Mistyped (Typographic)` errors, `Misspelled (Cognitive)` errors are harder to detect, especially by people who type it out. This error comes from the wrong understanding about the spelling of the word (called `Orthographic/Consitent`)

or divided into 2 categories:
- `Non-Word Error`, where the incorrect word form is not in the dictionary of correct words. And
- `Real-Word Error`, where the word is spelled incorrectly but its form is in the dictionary of correct words
