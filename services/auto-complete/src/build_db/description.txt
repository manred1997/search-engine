completions.dict: lists all the distinct tokens in the completions sorted in lexicographical order.

completions.mapped: lists all completions whose tokens have been mapped to integer ids as assigned by a lexicographically-sorted string dictionary (that should be built from the tokens listed in completions.dict). Each completion terminates with the id 0.

completions.mapped.stats contains some statistics about the datasets, needed to build the data structures more efficiently. # num terms (len vocabulary), max_len_completion, num docs

completions.inverted is the inverted file.

completions.forward is the forward file. Note that each list is not sorted, thus the lists are the same as the ones contained in completions.mapped but sorted in docID order.
